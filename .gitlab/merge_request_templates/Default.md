# content

(add a summarized description of the MR content)


### breakdown

(add a detailed list of changes, and link to the relevant commit-revision on each item.  
alternatively, use the below generated text to simply show the MR commits' messages)

<!--
an auto-generated list of the MR commits.  if any commit titles include a type prefix
(e.g. "fix", "feat", "docs"), the list will be categorized by type.  
if you only see {all_commits} here but no text was generated, cancel and re-open the MR.
-->
%{all_commits}


# screen captures

| before                                       | after                            |

| (attach a "before" screenshot or video here) | (attach an "after" capture here) |


# ticketing

(state the ticket or tickets this MR pertains to, e.g. "closes HAC-123, HAC-234".  
note that "fixes", "closes" or "resolves" (case-insensitive) will automatically
move the ticket(s) to "review" upon merge.  
to avoid this, you can use e.g. "addresses HAC-123")
