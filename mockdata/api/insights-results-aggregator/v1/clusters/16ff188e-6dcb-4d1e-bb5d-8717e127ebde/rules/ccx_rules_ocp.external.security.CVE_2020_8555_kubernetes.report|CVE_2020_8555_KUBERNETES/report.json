    "details": "The running OpenShift version is vulnerable to CVE-2020-8555: Compromised node could escalate to cluster level with Moderate security impact.\n\nThis flaw allows an attacker who can intercept requests on a compromised node to redirect those requests, along with their credentials, to perform actions on other endpoints that trust those credentials (including other clusters), allowing for escalation of privileges.\n",
    "reason": "* The cluster is running OpenShift {{=pydata.current_version}}.\n",
    "resolution": "Red Hat recommends that you upgrade the OpenShift cluster to a more recent version. \n\nFor more information, see the *Updating a cluster within a minor version from the web console* section of the documentation of the OpenShift version:\n\n* [OpenShift {{=pydata.minor_version}}](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/{{=pydata.minor_version}}/updating/updating-cluster.html)\n",
